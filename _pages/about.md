Hi everyone, I'm Jiate Li, an incoming Ph.D. student at Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, **University of Southern California**. supervised by Prof. [Yue Zhao](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/). For ease of pronouncing you can call me *Jet Lee*.

Before joining USC, I worked as a remote research intern under the mentorship of Prof. [Binghui Wang](https://wangbinghui.net/) from **Illinois Institute of Technology**, and conducted research on the *GNN Trustworthiness* in 2022-2024. In 2024-2025, I worked as a research assitant under the mentorship of Prof. [Siqiang Luo](https://siqiangluo.com/) in CCDS at **Nayang Technology University**, where I researched on *GNN applications*. I received my bachelor degree at **Zhejiang University** in 2022 and my master degree at **National University of Singapore** in 2023.
