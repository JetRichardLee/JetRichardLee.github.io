Hi everyone, I'm Jiate Li, an incoming Ph.D. student at Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science, **University of Southern California**. supervised by Prof. Yue Zhao. For ease of pronouncing you can call me Jet Lee. Before joining USC, I worked as a research intern under the mentorship of Prof. Binghui Wang from **Illinois Institute of Technology**, and conducted research on the *GNN Trustworthiness* in 2022-2024. I also worked as a research assitant under the mentorship of Prof. Siqiang Luo in CCDS at **Nayang Technology University**, where I researched on *GNN applications* in 2024-2025. I received my bachelor degree at **Zhejiang University** in 2022 and my master degree at **National University of Singapore** in 2023.
